Lab 3 Analysis

Besides, your code, you could provide an analysis of the two methods: 
which algorithm is the best on various graph sizes? How many vertices can each method handle?

As for which algorithm will be best when dealing with varying graph sizes, greedy will be able to handle a lot more than twice-around-the-tree.

For Greedy when went as far as 20,000 with no problems. However, with twice-around-the-tree we cannot go as high, only into the hundred.
